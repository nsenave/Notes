> generally speaking, "Dynamic Programming" is an approach to writing algorithms when you can solve a subset of the problem and use that as part of the solution for the larger problem.

> Memoized recursion is one potential implementation for a dynamic programming algorithm, but it's not the only one - for example the most 
> common Dynamic Programming example (Levenshtein Distance) is usually implemented with a matrix instead: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance#Iterative_with_full_matrix
